# ML-Project-Samuele-Magatti

## Project Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to implement a classification task using three different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
The expected output is supposed to be able to correctly classify the images of the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset, available on Kaggle: [](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors) 
into the labels rock, paper or scissors.  
 
## Dataset
Due to its size the dataset is not included in this repository.
It can be downloaded, as previously said, from kaggle [](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors)
